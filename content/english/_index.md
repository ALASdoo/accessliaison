        The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 508, European Accessibility Act (EAA), and other laws require all documents on websites to be accessible to users with diverse abilities.

        Standard PDFs, Word documents, and presentations are often inaccessible to users relying on assistive technologies like screen readers.

        We handle complex files, 100+ page documents, and multi-language content with ease.
