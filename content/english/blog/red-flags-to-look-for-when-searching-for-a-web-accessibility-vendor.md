Some businesses that have already invested in their website’s accessibility are getting sued. That happens because they rely on so-called ‘accessibility solutions’ that don’t work. How can you avoid this trap?

The most efficient solution is to choose a trusted web accessibility solution provider that can help you confidently navigate digital accessibility. How can you do that if you are not an expert yourself? It might not be an easy task, but there is a lot you **can** do. Make sure you learn the most important facts and watch out for the red flags.

## Red flag 1: Too narrow scope

Web accessibility involves a broad range of expertise, from legal knowledge to design, development, quality assurance (QA), and user experience (UX). If a vendor focuses on just one aspect and neglects the others, they may not have the depth of knowledge needed to support your project in the long run. This can create gaps in your accessibility strategy, forcing you to seek additional support later, which takes more time and resources.

### Failure to offer ongoing support

Web accessibility is an ongoing process, not a one-time project. If a vendor doesn't offer post-audit support, such as providing remediation assistance or regular checkups, it suggests they may not understand the evolving nature of web accessibility.

### Overlay widgets/plugins as compliance solutions

The point of accessibility changes is to make the product itself accessible and in line with industry requirements. Overlay widgets are not a valid solution. Using an overlay on faulty code is like decorating a crumbling house — the decorations won’t make it safer or help it pass inspection.

Overlays may help with surface-level issues like color contrast, but they cannot address deeper issues, such as semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and heading hierarchy.

### Minimal focus on user experience (UX)

Accessibility isn't just about compliance — it’s about creating a positive experience for users with disabilities. If the vendor focuses solely on meeting the letter of the law without considering the user experience, they may be missing a key component of web accessibility.

### Inadequate knowledge of legal and compliance requirements

You could put your organization at risk if a vendor doesn’t stay up to date with current legal requirements. They must be able to explain how their services align with laws and standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, European ICT standard EN 301 549, or the USA’s procurement standard Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

## Red flag 2: Unreal promises

### Overpromising results

If a vendor is promising 95% coverage with an automated tool, that is a major red flag. Typically, **automation can cover 30–50% of issues**, even with the help of AI. Depending on the type of platform and content, the coverage can be even lower. **The majority of the audit and remediation must be done manually** by experienced experts using assistive technology.

### Claim their audits are done only by testers who are blind

User testing with persons with disabilities, including testers who are blind, is a valuable part of accessibility evaluation. However, a full audit involves assessing a range of factors, including visual and structural elements. Instead of promising impossible scenarios, a vendor should demonstrate familiarity with various assistive technologies, especially screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## Red flag 3: Does not apply accessibility best practices

### Inadequate level of accessibility on their website

You don’t have to be an expert to get a glimpse of a website’s accessibility. Here is one quick check you can do:

1. Put your cursor at the end of the website’s address in the address bar.
2. Press the Tab key to go into the page and through the whole page.
3. Check if you can move using the Tab key to all links, buttons, and input fields (in dropdowns and modal dialogs too).
4. Check that the focus indicator (usually a solid or dotted line around the element) always shows exactly where you are on the page.

If you cannot always see the indicator, access and close dialogs, or reach the help chat or other functionalities, this is a major red flag. If they cannot follow these basic accessibility requirements for their website, how will they help you with yours?

### Non-existent or vague accessibility statement

An accessibility statement on the vendor’s website should be easy to find and detailed. It should include the level of conformance, which steps were taken to achieve it, and the accessibility features on their website explained. It should also be up-to-date and regularly maintained (check the creation or modification date).

## Red flag 4: Lacking professionalism and reliability

### No certified experts

The only recognized body for accessibility certification is the {{< link_external url="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/" >}}International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP){{< /link_external >}}. You can require confirmation from them if somebody has the certificate (CPACC, WAS, CPWA). Experts should also have the badge and certificate number with an expiring date on their LinkedIn profile. Not all accessibility experts need to have the certificate to do their job properly. It’s a red flag only if no one in the organization holds a certification. It means that they do not invest in education enough and are probably missing the bigger picture.

### Unclear or unreasonable pricing

Transparency in pricing is crucial. If the vendor is hesitant to discuss their fees or offers prices that seem too low or excessively high for the services they provide, it could be a sign they are not legitimate or are cutting corners.

### Unclear communication or lack of transparency

Good communication is key throughout the accessibility audit process. If the vendor is unresponsive, doesn’t provide regular updates, or lacks transparency in their work, it could indicate a lack of professionalism.

## Conclusion: The right vendor will have your best interest at heart

When meeting with a potential vendor, ask yourself the following questions:

- Are they interested in understanding your specific situation and challenges?
- Are they simply selling their tool, forcing you to adapt to their processes?
- Are they willing to find the best approach tailored to your needs, adapting to your existing processes?
- Do they address the broader context of ongoing accessibility and the evolving legal landscape in your market?

A good sign is when the vendor asks about the specifics of your product, considering the types of content and issues that may arise. They should also discuss the conformance levels you need to focus on. A reliable vendor will demonstrate their expertise by analyzing your current processes and identifying areas where accessibility best practices can be applied.
